        Welcome to CARE/Optim INR Monitoring APP
    </strong>
</p>
<p>Your Clinician has decided that you would benefit from taking a medication called an Anticoagulant. It is prescribed for people who are at increased risk for developing harmful blood clots. The goal of anticoagulant therapy is to decrease the clotting tendency of blood, but not to prevent clotting completely. Therefore, the blood's ability to clot must be carefully monitored. And CARE INR APP <br>1) Adjust the dose to maintain the clotting time within a target range.<br>2) Help track your INR Records <br>3) Reminds for your dosing and for Periodically INR Tests

    <strong>
        What is PT/INR?
    </strong>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        PT (Prothrombin) and INR (International Normalized Ratio) are both measures of how long it takes your blood to clot.
    </li>
    </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Who needs a PT/INR test?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	If you take a blood-thinning medication such as warfarin. your doctor will recommend a PT/INR test to check the medication is working effectively. </li>
            <li>   	A PT/INR test can also be requested in people not taking anticoagulants, to check for bleeding disorders, and liver problems. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What do your INR results mean?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	For people taking warfarin, the INR target range will be different for different people, depending on the condition for which the warfarin is being prescribed.  In most situations, the target INR is between 2 to 3. For some who have a high risk of a blood clot, the INR needs to be higher â€“ about 2.5 to 3.5.</li>
            <li>	If your INR is above the target range, this means that your blood is clotting too slowly and you are at risk of bleeding.</li>
            <li>	If your INR is below the target range, this means that your blood is clotting more quickly than ideal (for people on warfarin) and you may be at risk of unwanted clots being formed. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                About oral Anticoagulants</strong><br>Anticoagulants, commonly referred to as blood thinners, are chemical substances that prevent or reduce coagulation of blood, prolonging the clotting time but these medications don't really thin your blood. Instead, they help prevent or break up dangerous blood clots that form in your blood vessels or heart.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>
                Side Effects</strong><br>A possible side effect of anticoagulants is excessive bleeding (haemorrhage), because these medicines increase the time it takes forblood clots to form.<br>Signs of excessive bleeding can include
        <ul>
            <li>	bleeding from the gums</li>
            <li>	blood in the urine</li>
            <li>	bloody or dark stool</li>
            <li>	a nosebleed</li>
            <li>	Blood vomiting and blood coughing up blood</li>
            <li>	In women, heavy or increased bleeding during your periods</li>
            <li>	If you notice any severe or recurrent bleeding, seek medical attention immediately. Contact your GP or go to emergency department.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            <strong>
                What food and medications can affect PT and INR results?
            </strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>	Some antibiotics can increase the PT and INR. Barbiturates, oral contraceptives and hormone-replacement therapy (HRT), and vitamin K (either in a multivitamin or liquid nutrition supplement) may decrease PT.</li>
            <li>	Drinking alcohol can also affect PT results. </li>
            <li>	Certain foods, such as beef and pork liver, green tea, broccoli, chickpeas, kale, turnip greens, and soybean products, contain large amounts of vitamin K and can alter PT results. </li>
            <li>	It is important that a healthcare provider knows about all of the drugs, supplements, and foods that you have consumed recently so that the PT and INR results are interpreted and used correctly.</li>
        </ul>
